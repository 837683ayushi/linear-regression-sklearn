# linear-regression-sklearn
Submission for "How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1' by Siraj Raval on YouTube

## Overview
The notebook is split into two sections: 2D linear regression on a sample dataset [X, Y], and 3D multivariate linear regression on a climate change dataset [Year, CO2 emissions, Global temperature].

2D Linear Regression | 3D Multivariate Linear Regression

1 | 2 | 3


## Usage
Run the jupyter notebook `linear_regression.ipynb`

##Challenge
> The challenge for this video is to use scikit-learn to create a line of best fit for the included 'challenge_dataset'. Then, make a prediction for an existing data point and see how close it matches up to the actual value. Print out the error you get. 

> Bonus points if you perform linear regression on a dataset with 3 different variables

## Dependencies
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
